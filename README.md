To make it work, create a file called "local_properties.js" without quotes inside the main directory of the project.

Add these lines inside the file:

// TMDb API
const API_KEY_TMDB = "PUT YOUR API KEY HERE";
const ACCESS_TOKEN_TMDB = "PUT YOUR ACCESS TOKEN HERE";

Then replace the text between the double quotes with your own values for the variables above.
